# ZoomAutoJoin
A chrome extension that automatically joins Zoom calls that you can schedule. Because I like to get distracted and would like to skip online classes less.

Currently does not have many features such as a 12 hour time format, an ordered list of meetings, and good visuals. But it's usable.
